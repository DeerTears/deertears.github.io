## I hate hanging onto stuff I could be throwing out

For someone with ADHD, who struggles to put things away and clean up, I get an immense satisfaction from throwing things away. Tossing broken clothes,  recycling paper, putting items into a donations bin, and especially deleting files.

Now, this is kinda dangerous, because I have ADHD, I don't have a great track record on what I *need* at the moment. It's mostly based on vibes, like "I don't need this project file anymore" or "I stopped working on this for months, why would years from now be any different?" or "I finished it, so I can delete it".

Not only have I proven myself wrong on all these fronts, but I've certainly lost things that I would treasure if I had access to again, I just don't remember ever having it. That's kind of the double-edged sword with trying to be **too** clean about your files.

I also hate the anxiety that comes with knowing you've got a full disk drive. Like, your computer might just not start up one day because it got too full. If I don't have 100gb available at all times, what if I need to install a game that's 80gb in size? Then the anxiety grows with that remaining 20gb.

I've come to understand that my data **is** kinda worth keeping, and with the terrabytes of storage available to me as a computer user, I really *can* afford to just stock up. My interm solution before I can spend hefty amounts of money to get several terrabytes of physical drives has been to get a Mediafire subscription. It's been really nice actually just being able to send someone a link that instantly downloads the file they wanted from me, like music stems or chunky graphic design deliverables. Putting less of my data with Google puts me at ease, at least.

Anyway, my current plan with my laptop, which has gotten pretty dang slow, is to wipe it. Again. I do it pretty routinely just to trim out the bloat, caches, and drivers installed that I'm not using anymore. This laptop started as a studying device for music classes in university. Then it was my teaching terminal when I taught coding lessons in a classroom. But it's always been my weapon of choice for music making with FL Studio.

## FL Studio, why can't I quit you?

Even with a lifetime license, I really want to leave the FL train in favour of Reaper, I hate the way FL organizes its VSTs and I can never truly figure out what it wants to see in the folder/file structure. It's also got little quirks that get tiring, like how pasting notes or patterns will move everything off a grid step to show that you pasted something. Instead of just telling you that you pasted something and letting you move it in place, or putting it in the next available free space or something.

## Reaper has been hard to learn

It's just so complicated in many ways. I figured out single-track recording, mixing, and rendering. I got a little bit into the process of making MIDI tracks, but the MIDI editor of FL Studio has spoiled me too well.

## My current plan

When I finally back everything up and wipe this laptop already - for real this time - I'm gonna try to install some Windows 10 presets to minimize the bloat and telemetry of the OS. I trust firefox will update enough to keep me protected against like a day0 attack, and I trust Windows Defender (although maybe not without OS updates?) will be strong enough to stop any weird VST .dll or Synthedit preset that I download.

I might still occasionally use this laptop for the hard stuff that I don't want to do, like taxes, but only because separating my gamespace from a dedicated work-from-home space has been so difficult. I hope moving to somewhere larger will solve that in of itself.

A laptop really seems like the ultimate device for music production. You're moving around a lot to different instruments and playing with different musicians, and you need some way to record all that stuff from any location.

Shame the battery doesn't really work anymore, and the model is too old to be replaced, but at least an extension cord solves most problems there.

Wish me luck, hope I don't delete anything too important.
