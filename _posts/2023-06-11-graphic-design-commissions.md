I've been designing personalized logos and layouts for clients since 2019. After training at SAIT for two and a half years, I know what it takes to make something worth printing. Below are some of the works I'm allowed to share publicly. If you're interested, [give me a shout](mailto:gdnghtgrl@gmail.com) if you'd like to talk about my design work! <sub>(No agencies, thanks.)</sub>

## Logos

## Layouts

## Publications

## Merchandise
